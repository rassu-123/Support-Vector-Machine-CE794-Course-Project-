# Support-Vector-Machine-CE794-Course-Project-

> In this project, we built a Support Vector Mechanism (SVM) algorithm from scratch and then
implemented it in a step-by-step fashion. We also learned the underlying mathematical concepts of SVM and how to solve the optimization problem using different approaches.

> As a sample data set, on which our model is trained and tested, we have used placement stats
of a certain collage and an accuracy of 80.7% is obtained. Furthermore, the accuracy of can be
increased by using Hyper-parameter tuning.

> Implementing the Support Vector Machine from scratch enables us to build a deeper understanding of the fundamental and underlying concepts. Such knowledge will prove useful when exploring some of the more complicated extensions that build on top of this algorithm
